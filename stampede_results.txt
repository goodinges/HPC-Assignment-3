Notes:
  - On 16-core nodes, parallelizing up to 8 threads speeds up the proceess. More than that
  is time sharing and degrade the performance dramitacally.
  - If N is not big enough the overhead of parallelization defeats it's purpose. For
  my jacobi implementation for example N=5000 shows the advantage clearly.
